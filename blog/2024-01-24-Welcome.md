Hello, and welcome to [magiquest.wiki](https://magiquest.wiki)! Even though the site's on version 0.5.3, there haven't been any blog posts. Time to change that! This welcome post will provide a description of the project and what *you* can do to help out. A roadmap will be published in the near future with v0.6.0.

## Description

This site, [magiquest.wiki](https://magiquest.wiki), is a wiki ***mirror*** site of [magiquest.fandom.com](https://magiquest.fandom.com). The end goal isn't for this site to fully replace the Fandom, but to go alongside it, catering to those looking for an ad-free experience. There are multiple reasons why this site, even if it tried, most likely *couldn't* overtake the Fandom, but I'll get to that later.

### Meaning of "Mirror"

For those who don't know what I mean by a wiki mirror site, this passage should help explain it. Mirror sites are websites that have been copied and hosted on another server. Most mirror sites are completely identical to the original in both architecture and content, but on a different URL. In simple terms, a mirror site is an alternative source for the same content. This site is different, though, as my only goal is to be identical in the content, not architecture. This means that even though it looks and feels different, the text, images, and videos are the same.

### Why a mirror site?

As stated in the inital description, the site is catering to those who are looking for an ad-free experience. The biggest reason why the audience is so specific is because the Fandom most likely couldn't be overtaken, so it's best to recognize that and understand the people who *still* would use the site. Those who would still use the site would most likely be fans of MQ and already have a link to the site. Due to Fandom's SEO [Search Engine Optimization] it's hard to pass them in search results. This site doesn't even have *basic* SEO currently, but I'm working on it. One day, this site may be able to pass the Fandom, but for the forseable future it'll sit as the second or third result. I think that's okay though, you don't always need to be the best at everything you do.

### Where's the site at now?

Even though [at the time of writing] it's on version 0.5.3, the site still has painfully obvious placeholder pages, entire sections of content missing, and a pretty basic layout. Take, for example, the "Adventures in MagiQuest Chronicles" or "Adventures in ShadowQuest" categories. MQ Chronicles is completely empty and SQ has two pages with the text "Placeholder Template Page." That's because, like the Fandom is doing for rewrites, I'm prioritizing pages related to MQ Legacy. By 1.0.0, all pages will have to be mirrored from the Fandom, but that's for the future.

## Contributing

Are you interested in helping out? That's great! Read below to help you get started.

### Writing new pages / Editing existing pages

Since this site is a mirror, these kinds of contributions are best on the [Fandom wiki](https://magiquest.fandom.com). If you do make an edit or write a new page, feel free to copy it over to this site as well! To learn how to start writing for the Fandom, see [here](https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Help:Contributing), [here](https://magiquest.fandom.com/wiki/MagiQuest_Wiki:Style_Guide), [here](https://magiquest.fandom.com/wiki/MagiQuest_Wiki:Wiki_Rules), and [here](https://trello.com/b/LpLOip38/magiquest-wiki). You can also join the [MagiQuest Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6e4whagCph), head over to the [#wiki-forum](https://discord.com/channels/461720155253243904/1136058315609231380) channel, and read the [pinned post](https://discord.com/channels/461720155253243904/1142551112579285153).

### Adding Fandom pages / Adding Fandom updates

Keeping up-to-date with the Fandom can be challenging, especially while adding new pages at the same time. That's where *you* come in! If you're reading a page and notice it's outdated compared to the Fandom's, or if a page you want is missing, you can contribute to fix that. It's expected that you have knowledge of [Markdown](https://commonmark.org), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow). Make sure to read the [Style Guide](https://magiquest.wiki/style_guide) and [Wiki Rules](https://magiquest.wiki/wiki_rules), then fork, code, and make a pull request! It's also recommended to use a template page, which can be found [here](https://github.com/MagiQuest/wiki/tree/main/src/pages). Happy contributing!
