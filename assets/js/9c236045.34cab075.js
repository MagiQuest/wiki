They unlock specific powerful abilities depending on which ones you own. Many of them will allow you to instantly defeat powerful foes, or quickly help residents of the kingdom without trouble.

Most toppers also have lights in them, and will flash when casting.","permalink":"/toppers"},{"id":"Info_About_MagiQuest/Game_Mechanics/wands","title":"Wands","description":"This article is a stub.
