They unlock specific powerful abilities depending on which ones you own. Many of them will allow you to instantly defeat powerful foes, or quickly help residents of the kingdom without trouble. Others can provide hints, or even cause a chaos effect. However, since these abilities are so powerful, they need to be recharged once used. Most toppers also have lights in them, and will flash when casting.","permalink":"/toppers"},{"id":"Info_About_MagiQuest/Game_Mechanics/wands","title":"Wands","description":"This article is a stub.
