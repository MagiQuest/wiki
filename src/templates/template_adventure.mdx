:::note

This page is about the adventure in MagiQuest Legacy. For other versions, see [here](https://magiquest.wiki).

:::

Introduce the adventure. Check a couple different versions of the ABOW for what it believes to be crucial elements of the story, and mention main characters. This should be no more than a few sentences.

## Walkthrough

### Requirements

This section will vary based on how the adventure is structured. All of them will have a short "Requirements" subheading. Then further subheadings divide the adventure into sections.

### Section 2

There should be multiple steps in each section.

### Section 3

Another example would perhaps be dividing the Princess and Goblin adventure into "Dueling the Goblin King" and "Finding the Princess' Jewels."

## Rune Reward

Titled after whatever the name of the rune is, explain it's uses. Is it used in dueling? If so, what is the effect and upgraded effect? Even if it isn't used in a duel, usually it's power is explained by the character who gives it to you. Does it unlock anything else?

## Strategy and Tips

- This should be a bullet point list on anything useful an average person should know about how to complete the adventure, that can't be addressed easily in the walk through. These should apply to most locations.

## Collaboration

Only include this if it's relevant. Not everyone is going to have knowledge of these functions since they're obscure, but at the very least the base 5 adventures have them.

## Trivia

- Anything else that's worth mentioning or is fun. Can be location specific.

## Locations

- Use the complete list from the Rune of Dragons page as a basis since it has all of them in the proper order. Remove locations as needed.

## References

- It would be nice to cite some sources, you can do so at the end.
