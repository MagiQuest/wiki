:::note

This page is about the rune in MagiQuest Legacy. For other versions, see [here](https://magiquest.wiki).

:::

Introduce the rune and it’s power in the most basic form. Mention any clan association it may have, and what set it’s apart of.

## Obtaining

Detail the quest for obtaining the rune. What items do they need to find? How many? Do they need to be found in a certain order? Who do you turn the items in to? If the quest is different in anything besides position of items at different realm types (like the Portal Rune at Pigeon Forge vs a lodge), separate the section into two paragraphs, even if you have to repeat stuff.

## Uses

What adventures is this rune used for? How do you use the power of the rune in that adventure?

## Trivia

 - This can be a difficult section depending on how familiar you are with the game. We want to try and have at least one trivia point in each article. Is there some interesting history behind how the quest has changed over time? What about any similarities to other quests? Consider what the objects do in freeplay. You could even take MagiQuest culture into account, as seen on the Lightning Rune page.

## Locations

 - Use the order given on the Enchant Creature page as a basis. It has the locations in the proper order (opening order) with the offical names. Remove names from the list as needed.

## References

 - Sources and references used throughout the article should be put at the bottom.
