Introduce the location by describing it's realm type, how much content it has, any exclusive content or noteworthy packages (this includes mentioning whether its a Goblin or Ursa lodge)

## MagiQuest Content

Just a bullet point list of quests and adventures, divided up into the in-game offical categories. There is an offical order, but copying off the Pigeon page and putting ursa stuff at the end of the lists should be fine. CompassQuest content goes after Ursa content. You can also create a seperate section for “ShadowQuest Content”

## Game Areas

This is where things can get a little tricky. You don't need to describe every single object in each area, even if you could. It's just too much info. Instead describe the atmosphere, vibe, and aesthetic of area, and any major elements like characters.

For lodges with CompassQuest, this can be… alot of sections with not a ton of text in them. This should be fine? Just try and break up the boring walls of text with pictures if possible. Be sure to mention which floor the areas are on, and start from the bottom floor upwards.

## Notable Features

Honestly… isn't going to be needed on any lodge page except Dells. There's really nothing notable about most lodges compared to other locations that actively effects gameplay. You could maybe argue Grand Mound or Grapevine needs a section about their size. Maybe.

## History

Just follow the format outlined on the Pigeon page. Adding months would be good if you know them. When did the lodge open? When did it get any added content down the road? In later years did the placement of any objects change? (since there won't be much else to talk about, but don't get too specific if there's lots of changes).

## Ancient Book of Wisdom

Link to a subpage like on Pigeon's. Lodges don't have offical ABOWs so you'll need to create a gallery with pictures or scans of a book. Ask for help on how to format it.

## Trivia

  - Just throw in any other fun bits of knowledge here.

## Gallery

Pretty self explainitory. It would be neat if you could order the images in the gallery to show off areas in the same order as the game areas category.
