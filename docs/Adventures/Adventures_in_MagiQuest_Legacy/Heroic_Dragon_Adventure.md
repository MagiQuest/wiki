This adventure consist of fighting both [Charlock](docs\Missing_Page.md) and [Winterra](docs\Missing_Page.md), switching between the two battles. This encounter took place at the same station as Charlock's encounter, as both Charlock and Wintera appear there.

This quest requires that you have previously beaten Winterra, and by proxy Charlock.

This adventure was only found within Kingdom Realms as the Ice Dragon Saga has not been added to Forest Realms, and Heroic quests were even rarer.
