:::note

This page is about the adventure in MagiQuest Legacy. For other versions, see [here](docs\Missing_Page.md).

:::

The **Dragon Adventure**, also known as the Red Dragon Adventure or Fire Dragon Adventure, brings [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md) face to face with the fearsome red dragon: [Charlock](docs\Missing_Page.md). He has been wrecking havoc the kingdom, forcing residents to give up their gold and valuables. The [Quest Master](docs\Missing_Page.md) tasks Magi with entering the Dragon's Lair, battling Charlock, taking back the treasure, and forcing Charlock to leave the kingdom in peace. The adventure has a more challenging counterpart in the form of the [Heroic Dragon Adventure](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Heroic_Dragon_Adventure.md).

### Walkthrough

#### Requirements

To succeed on the adventure, Magi must possess the [Rune of Freezing](docs\Missing_Page.md), [Rune of Protection](docs\Missing_Page.md), [Portal Rune](docs\Missing_Page.md), and [Ice Arrow Rune](docs\Missing_Page.md). At [Mega Kingdom Realms](docs\Realm_Locations\index.mdx), the [Reveal Rune](docs\Missing_Page.md) is also required.

#### Entering the Dragon's Lair

Entering the Dragon's Lair requires knowledge of a secret code. Without it, Magi cannot proceed. The method of obtaining this code is different depending on the location. Magi are required to obtain the code each time they play the adventure, even if they already know it.

At Kingdom and Forest Realms the code can be found on the dragon painting. Casting at the painting will reveal the three symbols in the order they must be entered into the portal. At Mega Kingdom Realms, Magi are required to use the Reveal Rune to cast at three separate invisible rune markings. The markings must be found in order, and will show the code to enter at the portal.

Once at the portal at the front of the Dragon's Lair, Magi must first cast at the [Entry Crystal](docs\Missing_Page.md) to make sure they meet the requirements. If they do, they then cast at the correct three symbols engraved into the portal frame, followed by the portal symbol on the inner wall to cast their spell. They may now enter the dragon's lair and cast at the MQ symbol on the center podium. Once a Magi has done so, Charlock awakens from his slumber.

#### Dueling Charlock

<img src="\img\docs\one-time\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Dragon_Adventure\Charlock_Promo_Image.webp" alt="A duel against Charlock in Myrtle Beach, SC" width="180" hight="117" title="A duel against Charlock in Myrtle Beach, SC"></img> In a battle against Charlock, Magi must select a spell from the podium and cast it outwards. Depending on the location, you may be faced with a Point-and-Cast podium, or TouchDuel podium. When the battle begins, Charlock will wake up and briefly monologue before attacking with his fiery breath. Before he does so, the player should cast the Rune of Protection to mitigate the damage. If a Magi is wielding a dragon wand, the damage they take will be even further reduced. After the flames clear, Charlock will lash his tail at his opponent, providing an opportunity for the Magi to cast the Rune of Freezing. Successfully hitting the spell will stop Charlock in his tracks by blanketing him in ice. Finally, now that Charlock is unable to move, the player must use the Ice Arrow Rune, which shatters the ice around Charlock, and reduces his total mana by 1/3rd.

This cycle of protection, freeze, and ice arrow, repeats twice more. Charlock becomes progressively more impressed and enraged throughout the duel. After the third and final blow, Charlock will stumble onto the ground and admit defeat. He gives the Magi 2,500 gold pieces from his treasure, as well as the Rune of Dragons. To conclude the adventure, Magi must cast into the treasure pile to receive their gold.

### Rune of Dragons

<img src="\img\docs\one-time\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Dragon_Adventure\Dragon_rune.webp" alt="The Rune of Dragons" width="137" hight="192" title="The Rune of Dragons"></img> The Rune of Dragons is described by Charlock as "the most powerful of all dueling runes." In Magi Duels, it summons Charlock and his fiery breath to the battlefield dealing 50 points of mana damage to the opponent. When upgraded, it does 70 damage, making it by far the strongest offensive spell.

Outside of dueling, obtaining the Rune of Dragons is also a requirement for both the [Ice Dragon Adventure](docs\Missing_Page.md) and the [Silver Dragon Portal Adventure](docs\Missing_Page.md). Additionally, at the [Pigeon Forge, TN](docs\Realm_Locations\Pigeon_Forge_TN.md) location, wielding this rune permits Magi to unlock the Dragon Door. The door allows faster travel between the back of the Village Realm and Dragon Realm.

### Strategy and Tips

- Magi are able to cast the Rune of Protection as soon as Charlock awakes from his slumber, as well as right after they successfully land an Ice Arrow. There's no need to wait until Charlock starts to attack.
- Due to the way the encounter works, there will be a brief pause between video clips. Players can use this to their advantage to know exactly when they are able to cast their next spell.
- When using a TouchDuel podium, tapping on the rune will cause it to gain a white outline. Players can check if their spell has been successfully cast by glancing down at the podium, as the outline is removed once the spell has registered. Oddly, this strategy does not work for the final Ice Arrow cast, as it will remain outlined up until the next video plays.

### Collaboration

Originally, the Dragon Adventure did not require that the Magi who initiates the adventure have all of the needed runes. Other Magi with the the Reveal, Freeze and Protection Runes could cast those spells for the initiating player. The Portal and Ice Arrow Runes must have been owned by the initiator. Other Magi would join in the battle by stepping up to one of the two Collaboration Podiums, positioned on either side of the center podium. These side podiums only allowed the casting of the Freeze and Protection runes. Only the Magi at the center podium could cast the Ice Arrow Rune.

This mechanic was optional for regular battles, but was the main task of the Collaboration Rune. While the collaboration podiums remain standing at every location, the introduction of TouchDuel saw their functionality removed.

### Trivia

- This is one of two adventure playable at every MagiQuest location, the other being the Pixie Adventure.
- In Charlock's initial monologue, his tail briefly clips through his foot.
- The Charlock battle has the most unused video clips of any duel. In them, Charlock takes different stances when attacking the player.
