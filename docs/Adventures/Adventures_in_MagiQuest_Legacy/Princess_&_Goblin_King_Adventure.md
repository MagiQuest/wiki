This page is about the adventure in MagiQuest Legacy. For other versions, see [here](docs\Home.mdx).

:::

The **Princess & Goblin King Adventure**, sometimes simply referred to at the Goblin Adventure, tasks Magi with facing the [Goblin King](docs\Home.mdx), and returning Princess Candice's stolen jewelry. The Princess uses her jewels to create magic stars, and without them many of the creatures in the kingdom will loose their magical abilities. The [Quest Master](docs\Home.mdx) asks Magi to sneak into the Goblin King's Chambers, defeat the Goblin King in a duel, and return Candice's jewels to her. The adventure has a more challenging counterpart in the form of the Heroic Princess & Goblin King Adventure. 

### Walkthrough

#### Requirements

To complete this adventure, Magi must possess the [Lightning Rune](docs\Home.mdx) and the [Portal Rune](docs\Home.mdx). At [Myrtle Beach, SC](docs\Home.mdx), East Hanover, NJ, Lagunasia, JP, Tokyo Dome, JP, and [Pigeon Forge, TN](docs\Home.mdx), the [Distract Rune](docs\Home.mdx) is also required. 

#### Challenging the Goblin King

The adventure begins with Magi going straight to the Goblin King's Chambers. As with any encounter station, they must cast at the [entry crystal](docs\Home.mdx) first to check if they meet all of the requirements to enter. Afterwards, if they do, the Magi must cast at a nearby torch to light it, initiating the encounter.

If the location requires the use of the Distract Rune for the adventure, the Goblin Guard will stop the player by the entrance to the king's chamber and prevent them from going further. He cannot be dueled; instead, the player must sneak past him by using the Distract Rune, done by casting at a symbol of the rune on the wall. Doing so will cause the guard to lose focus and wander off to the nearby door. Failure to cast the spell results in the guard shooing the Magi away, then snacking on a rat as a reward for his hard work. This additional step does not appear at most locations.

Moving forward, the adventure is the same at all locations. The next step requires the use of the [Portal Rune](docs\Home.mdx) to enter the kingâ€™s chambers, which is done by casting at the Portal Rune symbol on the wall. The Goblin King will then enter his throne room with appropriate fanfare as the Magi approaches. After calling the Magi before him a weakling in various ways, he will offer to tell them how to find the jewels they seek on one condition: they must defeat him in battle.

During the duel, the player uses the Lightning Rune to drain the mana of the Goblin King by casting at him. The King will use his own lightning powers granted by his bone scepter to attack the Magi. While the King will always move first, he is generally slower than the Magi. This allows the player to strike multiple times between each of the Goblin King's attacks. The player cannot dodge or negate the damage of the King's lighting, and must simply be quicker than him. The optimal time to cast is when the King is fumbling around, attempting to dodge the player's lightning. After five blasts of lightning, the King's mana will be fully depleted. The Goblin King then tells the Magi that they may now collect the Princess's jewels by waving their wand at them.

#### Finding the Princess's Jewels

Princess Candice's jewels are scattered differently depending on the realm. Some, like Myrtle Beach, SC or Pigeon Forge, TN, have them all in one game area. In other locations, players will find them throughout the entire [realm](docs\Realm_Locations\index.mdx). Magi will need to seek out the Princess's ring, necklace, tiara, bracelet, broach, and cast at them. The jewels can be found in any order. Once all of them are found, Magi must make their way to the Princess's abode. They first cast at the entry crystal outside, then place the jewels in the jewelry box. Candice will arrive and thank the player for returning the jewels, and then sing a portion of *Written in the Stars*. She goes on to explain that with her voice, she was able to turn the jewels into magic stars. To show her and the kingdom's gratitude, Candice rewards the Magi with 500 gold, and a rune given to her by her [great grandfather](docs\Home.mdx): the Andover Amulet.

### Andover Amulet

<img src="\img\Andover_Amulet.webp" alt="The Andover Amulet" width="137" hight="192"></img> The Andover Amulet is described by Princess Candice as an ancient rune with the power to reverse an opponent's spell. In Magi Duels, using the rune will cause the opponent's spell on the same turn to be reversed in a variety of ways. Spells that drain mana will cause the opponent to drain their own mana. Healing spells casted by the opponent will instead heal the user of the Andover Amulet. Shielding spells will fizzle, and do nothing. When upgraded, the rune will reverse and double the effects of the reversed spell. Damage dealing spells will deal double damage, and healing spells will double their healing. With proper usage, the Andover Amulet has the potential to become the strongest defensive spell and instantly end duels.

### Strategy and Tips

- There are proper openings and cues for when to attack the Goblin King. However, Magi can repeatedly cast during the duel without worrying about timing and still succeed.
- By the time that the player reaches this adventure, they are likely to have already ran into at least a couple of the princess's jewels in their quests.

### Collaboration

In the full version of the adventure, the Quest Master states that the only rune required by the Magi who begins the adventure is the Lightning Rune. The prompts to use the Distraction Rune and Portal Rune can be fulfilled by any nearby Magi with the runes. The extent to which this is true varies by location. At the Pigeon Forge, TN and Wisconsin Dells, WI realms, any Magi can cast the Lightning Rune at the Goblin King.

### Trivia

- All of the Princess's jewels give gold when casted at in both freeplay and on the adventure. This results with the Magi finishing the adventure with more than the 500 gold Princess Candice gives them
