The **Ursa Major Adventure** follows [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md) in their quest to help the Great Bear, [Ursa Major](docs\Home.mdx), return to the stars before he fades from existence. He was summoned by [Princess Amora](docs\Home.mdx) to solve a problem in the forest realm, when his amulet breaks, and he loses his ability to return to the stars. The Magi is tasked with learning where the amulet's base and all five of it's gemstones hide, then retrieving them to return to Ursa. This adventure and it's associated quests are part of the [Great Wolf Lodge Exclusive Content](docs\Home.mdx) set. 

### Walkthrough

#### Requirements

To accept this adventure, Magi must have collected the [Celestial Rune](docs\Home.mdx), as well as proven themselves to Amora by collecting the [Great Wolf Rune](docs\Home.mdx). 

#### Locating the Amulet

Amora advises Magi to first inquire with the Wolf and the Eagle, who dwell in a painting, as they may know where to find Ursa's amulet. When spoken to, the eagle directs Magi to the portrait of the Red-Shouldered Hawk. The Hawk, impressed but annoyed that the player found them, gives them a riddle. It is revealed that the amulet is located within a treasure chest, and that the Magi will need to cast at it three times.

Upon approaching the Amulet Chest, a Magi cannot open it on the first try. The chest simply taunts anyone who casts the first time. Upon showing persistence and casting again, the chest opens to reveal a smaller treasure chest inside. The chest again teases the player and asks to see what they can really do. It takes casting a third time for the smaller chest to open, revealing the Amulet.

Along with giving Magi the Ursa Amulet's base, the Amulet Chest also informs Magi of the specific order they must track down the missing gemstones in. This order is Ruby, Emerald, Sapphire, Topaz, and Diamond. They will be stones suspended in frames on the wall.

#### Returning and Repairing the Amulet

Once the amulet and it's five gemstones are collected, a Magi should proceed to the Pixie's Perch and cast at the entry crystal, then the Amulet Chest inside the perch. This will switch the encounter station to show the Great Bear visibly and audibly in pain. One by one, a Magi must return everything to the Ursa Major by casting at him with their wand. Ursa will stomp and roar with the power of each gemstone flowing through him as each one is inserted into the amulet. Failing to cast one of the gems will result in Ursa walking away with an unfinished amulet, asking for you to find the other gemstones. The encounter must be started over from the beginning if failed.

Upon successfully restoring the power of the amulet, and by extension his powers. Ursa will thank you, before his body begins to glow and turn to stars as he returns to the skies. An outline of the Ursa Major constellation will light up and the Magi will be congratulated by his voice coming from the sky. He will reward the player with the Ursa Major Amulet for their kindness.

When the Magi returns to a Quest Tree, they will be greeted once again by Princess Amora. She congratulates the player on being skilled and resourceful in saving Ursa Major. She remarks that [her grandfather](docs\Home.mdx) was right about the Magi's abilities. Amora wishes them good luck on their future travels, saying she'll see them again when their abilities are needed once more by the forest realm.

### Ursa Major Amulet

<img src="\img\Ursa_Major_Amulet.webp" alt="The Ursa Major Amulet" width="137" hight="192"></img> After restoring Ursa Major's power, he gives the Magi his amulet. He describes it has having the ability to summon him back from the stars, for when the player "need help defending yourself... from dark forces..." and that the Great Bear watches and guards over them. The power of the amulet is never used in-game. 

### Strategy and Tips

- The items for this adventure are commonly placed in areas that a Magi might not expect. For example, at [Concord, NC](docs\Home.mdx), the red-shouldered hawk is found in a dark corner behind the Quest Trees, and the emerald gemstone is on the side of a staircase on the second floor.

### Trivia

- The problem Amora mentions at the beginning of the adventure is never actually detailed, leaving what happened a true mystery.
- As Ursa describes the amulet he gives you as having the ability to summon him, it's possible it would be effected by the powers of the Bell of Opuesto Rune if it was allowed to be used in Magi Duels.
