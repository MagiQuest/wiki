# Welcome to my silly corner of the interwebs!

:::danger Watch Out!

This website isn't complete and may be missing some info that you're looking for! To request a new page or an expansion to an already existing one, head [here](https://github.com/dukedotdev/dukedot.dev/issues).

:::

Since you've stumbled upon this site, I assume that you want to learn about me! That's great and all, but if you're coming here from [Rec Room](docs\Rec_Room.md) or [Steam](docs\Steam.md), I recommend that you click the platform's respective hyperlink and read that page first. They may answer your questions and save you some time! Now for the rest of you,,,

Hey! I'm dukedotdev and I do a *lot* of stuff! I'm a 16 y/o trans girl who loves gaming, cybersecurity, developing things, and more! As a general rule of thumb, please stay out of my way if your account is NSFW as I'm a minor and don't wanna see that.

## Gaming

For PC gaming, I tend to use [Steam](docs\Steam.md), but I also use the Epic Games launcher a bit [FORTNITE!!!]. I own a desktop with Linux & Windows dual-booted, and a 512GB Steam Deck [Non-OLED]. On desktop I use my Linux install for general work and the Windows install for gaming. Some of my favorite games are [Mirror's Edge Catalyst](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1233570/Mirrors_Edge_Catalyst/), [Rec Room](https://store.steampowered.com/app/471710/Rec_Room/), [Dead by Daylight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/), [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/), [Escape the Backrooms](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1943950/Escape_the_Backrooms/), [Cruelty Squad](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1388770/Cruelty_Squad/), and [BIGFOOT](https://store.steampowered.com/app/509980/BIGFOOT/).

I do play on a Switch, but I only play Splatoon 3 on it. Since I own a hacked Switch, I've dumped all my other games and just run them on yuzu. If you want to add me though, feel free to add this friend code: ``SW-6190-5465-5039``

## Cybersecurity / Web & Game Dev

The cybersecurity part of this is currently more of a dream than an actual hobby of mine ðŸ˜…. I've done some ethical hacking in my free time before and am [currently participating in Rec Room's Bugcrowd program](https://dukedot.dev/rr#rr-bugcrowd), but I'm *far* from making this my actual job. This is the same for the web & game dev part too, but I've got a little more practice with those aspects. I've been making websites and tinkering with code since I was 8 and I still love it to this day! All of my old websites are long gone, but I'm currently managing two. One you're [currently on](https://dukedot.dev), and the other is [magiquest.wiki](https://magiquest.wiki)! Both are made using Docusaurus, mainly because I don't have the time to make a pure and original HTML, JS, and CSS *thing*. I've done it before, but working with a framework is much faster. On the game dev front, I've made some games in Rec Room and I've played around in Unity, Godot, and Unreal.

## Other

Not much I haven't talked about other than my obsession with MagiQuest. Have you heard about it? No? Head over [here](https://magiquest.wiki) and then come back after looking through :]
