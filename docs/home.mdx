# Welcome to the MagiQuest Wiki!

**MagiQuest** is a live-action roleplaying and scavenger game. Players, known in-game as Magi, take part in quests and adventures to collect runes and earn points. In their journeys, they may come across princesses, pixies, goblins, and dragons. Players use an electronic magic wand to interact with objects and characters. MagiQuest can be played at one of many real-world locations across the United States (and formerly Japan).

The **MagiQuest Wiki** is a collaborative community website that any Magi can expand. Since our wiki started in 2009, we've had [[*Automate w/ commit numb later*]] contributions! We're happy that you decided to help us in our quest to become a place where all MagiQuest fans can share their knowledge and thoughts about the game. All edits and questions in good faith are welcome here. We wish you good luck on your journey through this wondrous and magical world!

***Please Note:*** there are multiple versions of the MagiQuest game, referred to as Legacy, Chronicles, and Evergreen. This wiki aims to cover all three versions, but is currently focused on Legacy. As the wiki is quite old and has passed through many hands, we are currently renovating many pages that are not up to our modern standards.
