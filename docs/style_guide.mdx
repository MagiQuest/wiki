If you're looking to contribute, then this style guide was made for you!

## File Description
for files, you want to make sure that everything you type is lowercase. like the sentences im typing now!
another thing to look out for is spaces, as for the most part we use underscores instead.
dont forget to make every single file that you make an mdx file, this is important because that's what our compiler builds files as.
for categories make sure that they are for large sections, not just one off things. 

## Page Metadata
For page metadata, the ID section should always be lowercase, with no special characters or spaces. 
The title should alwasy be readable by a human, so that's where you'd use proper capitalization, spaces and proper sentence structuring!
The descriptions are mostly for embeds, but they still show on site, so make sure it's human readable!
Tags should be for grouping pages together, like the game version, category it's in, and the content set it's from.
The slug is like a link, so for that make sure it's all lowercase, underscores instead of spaces, and no special characters.
