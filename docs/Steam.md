## Can I add you?

Sure! I'll accept your friend request as long as your account isn't private or NSFW.

## Can we play games together?

Depends on the game! I'm always down for a good LC lobby, and I'm generally down for a fun time in most multiplayer games. If you want to play a game I don't have, then too bad! If it's free, I'll consider it, but if it's paid then no. Even if you're willing to gift me it, I don't feel comfortable getting gifts from people I don't know very well. If the game doesn't have in-game voice chat, then join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/npsnnd5JwT) and hop in a vc with me! You'll also meet a ton of other cool people, but please make sure to follow the rules and be respectful.

### Can we play Rec Room together?

Please see [this page](docs\Rec_Room.md)!

## Missing something?

If you need more info, make an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dukedotdev/dukedot.dev/issues) or message me on Steam with what you need.
