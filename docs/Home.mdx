# Welcome to the MagiQuest Wiki!

:::warning

This website is in very early access and is to show the possibilty of a Fandom alternative to the MagiQuest community. For the full wiki, go to [magiquest.fandom.com](https://magiquest.fandom.com)!

:::

MagiQuest is a live-action roleplaying and scavenger game. Players, known in-game as [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md), take part in quests and [adventures](docs\Adventures\index.mdx) to collect [runes](docs\Quests\index.mdx) and earn points. In their journeys, they may come across princesses, pixies, goblins, and dragons. Players use an electronic magic wand to interact with objects and characters. MagiQuest can be played at one of many real-world [locations](docs\Realm_Locations\index.mdx) across the United States (and formerly Japan).

The MagiQuest Wiki is a collaborative community website that any Magi can build and expand. We're happy that you decided to help us in our quest to become a place where all MagiQuest fans can share their knowledge and thoughts about the game. All edits (and questions!) in good faith are welcome here. We wish you good luck on your journey through this wondrous and magical world! 

***Please Note***: there are multiple versions of the MagiQuest game, referred to as Legacy, Chronicles, and Plus. This wiki aims to cover all three versions, but is currently focused on Legacy. As the wiki is quite old and has passed through many hands, we are currently renovating many pages that are not up to our modern standards. Please join the [MagiQuest Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/6e4whagCph) for more information, as well as to join in on community discussion!
