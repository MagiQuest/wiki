:::

The **Lightning Rune** is one of the original twelve [runes](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Runes.md) in MagiQuest. At locations where it is obtainable, it's the first rune shown on the quest selection screen and the first listed in the [Ancient Book of Wisdom](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\The_Ancient_Book_of_Wisdom.md). It's often the first rune a new Magi will seek out. It is associated with the Warrior Clan, and considered to be one of the most powerful runes, due to its ability to summon lightning on command. The quest has a more challenging counterpart in the form of the Heroic Lightning Rune.

### Obtaining

The quest for the Lighting Rune involves collecting- in any order- the Shield of Lightning, Sword of Lightning, Suit of Armor, and the Magi Warrior's Code Book. After a Magi acquires all four of these items, they must turn them in to either the Man in the Mist or The Gargoyle, depending on the game location.

### Uses

The Rune of Lightning is required to complete the [Princess and Goblin King Adventure](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Princess_&_Goblin_King_Adventure.md) and the Unicorn Adventure. It is also used in battle against the Goblin King and The Dark One. It can be casted in quick succession, draining a portion of the Goblin King's mana, or damaging The Dark One's disguise each time.

This Rune can also be used in Magi dueling. When used, the Lightning rune deals 20 points of damage. When upgraded, it deals 30 points of damage.

### Trivia

  - All of the items required for this quest give gold in freeplay. This trait is also shared by the [Enchant Creature Rune](docs\Quests\Enchant_Creature_Rune.md).
  - In it's earliest version, this quest would be finished at the [Duel Master's](docs\Missing_Page.md) Hut. However, the actress for Gwendolyn had not been casted yet, resulting in a strange video where the runes given to you by a disembodied voice on a black background. This lasted until 2008 exclusively at [Myrtle Beach, SC](docs\Missing_Page.md), when Thunder Cave and the Man in the Mist was introduced. At all locations besides Myrtle that opened before 2008, The Gargoyle gives you the rune.
  - The Lightning Rune is famous, or perhaps infamous, for how short the quest is. At [Wisconsin Dells](docs\Missing_Page.md), WI and [Pigeon Forge, TN](docs\Realm_Locations\Pigeon_Forge_TN.md), Magi will often go on the quest dozens of times to quickly rise up the [scoreboard](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Score_Boards.md).
