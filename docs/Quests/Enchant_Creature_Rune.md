:::

The **Enchant Creature Rune** is the second of the original twelve quest [runes](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Runes.md). As the signature rune of the [Woodsy Clan](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Clans\Woodsy_Clan.md), It grants the owner the ability to speak with the creatures within the world of MagiQuest. Its power can reveal many secrets of the kingdom to [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md) who wield it. The quest has a more challenging counterpart in the form of the Heroic Enchant Creature Rune.

### Obtaining

Four artifacts bearing the paw-print symbol of the rune must be casted at, in any order, for this quest. Three of the symbols are found in treasure chests. The fourth is engraved onto the side of a rock. At many locations, this stone appears within a painting, but others have a physical stone prop with the emblem on it. Once a Magi has collected all four symbols, they can head to [Serena the Pixie](docs\Home.mdx) for their reward.

### Uses

This rune is used two adventures. During the Pixie Adventure, it's used to communicate with Smudgy and Trixie the Trixter pixie. It's also used in the Duel Master Adventure to speak with Esmerelda the spider.

In Magi dueling, this rune deals 10 points of mana damage to the opponent and blocks 10 points of your own mana from being damaged. When upgraded, it will have the same effect but doubled, dealing and blocking 20 points of damage.

### Trivia

  - The Enchant Creature Rune is one of several quests found at every location.
  - All of the items for this quest give gold in freeplay. This is a trait shared by the items for the [Lightning Rune](docs\Quests\Lightning_Rune.md) quest.
