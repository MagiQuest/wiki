## Plot

### Setting

MagiQuest Legacy takes place within the kingdom of MagiNation, a medieval fantasy world with some steampunk elements. However, it also takes place within the real-world, with the kingdom of MagiQuest being able to be entered via realm portals at the real world locations the game takes place in. The world is inhabited by humans, pixies, goblins, and trolls, and other typical fantasy creatures such as dragons and unicorns appear as well. In this world, there are five major clans that Magi belong to: Warrior, Woodsy, Majestic, Shadow, and Trixter. Long ago they warred with each other, until eventually they come together to write The Great Compromise and form the Magi Council. Although the kingdom is in relative peace, dark forces linger within the shadows.

### Story

Players obtain their first wand and are introduced to the world of MagiQuest by the Quest Master. He is a jolly old wizard who guides Magi onto quests and adventures to obtain ancient runes, which will grant them new magical abilities. He suggests that his students earn these runes to strive to become Master Magi. In their adventures, Magi meet many of the kind inhabitants of the kingdom, including Princess Candice, Neland Quivermore, Gwendolyn the Duel Master, and more. They also encounter fantastical creatures, some friendly and some foes. Magi help Serena, the leader of the pixies, restore their species' ability to fly, and return Glittertail the unicorn's magic star to her. They do battle against The Dark One, the Goblin King, and Charlock the red dragon. After obtaining the Quest Master's eleven runes, the players are given the title of Master Magi.

It is only once players become Master Magi that the true secrets of the kingdom begin to reveal themselves. Carren, the daughter of the outcast brother of the Quest Master, Xavier, enters the picture. She, on behalf of the Magi Council, challenges the new Master Magi with earning new runes and dueling Winterra the ice dragon. Then, Gwendolyn takes on the role of quest giver. She presents the Master Magi with a set of quests based around the Five C's, the five words of which make up the most important traits of the Master Magi. The quests lead the Master Magi to gain a greater understanding of themselves and the world around them, bettering themselves as a person and becoming champions, then heroes, of the realms.

Meanwhile, Lokari, an apprentice of the Quest Master, has innovated a new form of technology allowing Magi to open portals into the virtual world, to the disapproval of others. His students manage to free a trapped prisoner and defeat the fearsome golem guarding her cell. However, the event provides The Silver Dragon an opportunity to attempt to escape the virtual world and plunder the real world. Lokari and Willow team up with the Magi to stop the Silver Dragon and prevent the destruction.

MagiQuest Legacy's story was cut short following a 2010 acquisition of Creative Kingdoms. It's believed that the next chapter of the story would have brought Magi face to face with Xavier, where they would battle him to protect the kingdom.
