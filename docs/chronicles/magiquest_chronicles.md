**MagiQuest Chronicles** (also formerly known as MagiQuest 2.0) is a series of live-action role playing games created by Creative Kingdoms. It is the second version of the game in the overall MagiQuest series, and encompasses three separate but interconnected games. The games follow players, known as Magi, on their journey to become Master Magi and save the realm of Vellara. The game is notable for bringing the MagiQuest series into the Unity game engine.

Debuting in 2013 in Wisconsin Dells, WI, Journey to Save the Light is the first game in the MagiQuest Chronicles series. The game is actually built within MagiQuest Legacy and is currently only playable at locations with Legacy, despite not taking place in the same world. It acted as a prototype for what was to come for the series. The game features two adventures and ten quests. The story follows Magi working with Lumina and Ivan to save the skylights from the shadow lord Malaki.
