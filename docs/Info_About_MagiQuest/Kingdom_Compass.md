A **Compass** is an item that is used whenever playing [Compass Quest](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Content_Sets\CompassQuest.md). It functions in a similar way to a [wand](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Wands.md) in which the player uses the compass to activate the various areas in the game. It also unlocks 9 additional quests the player can play through. The compass itself can open up similar to that of a real compass.

The compass previously was used to call Magi to the Stone circle, typically as a tool for parents to get regrouped with their kids.
