**Chaos Powers** are special abilites granted only by a select few [toppers](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Toppers.md). Chaos powers are triggered by casting at a specific effect that can be different depending on the location you're playing at. When triggered, nearly every effect in the building will activate. Status stations will play a video, chests open, lights turn on, and almost anything with a speaker will play a sound effect. The exact sounds and videos differ depending on which topper is being used. Chaos powers must be recharged like most other topper powers.

### Types of Chaos Powers

#### Summon Xavier - Blue Claw Topper

The most infamous of all chaos powers is the ability granted by the blue claw. Once triggered, [Xavier](docs\Home.mdx) will make his pressence known by causing every effect to echo his laughter. Status stations will also play a video of him laughing. The power to summon him again must be recharged by collecting one of each quest [rune](docs\Home.mdx).

#### Power of Laughter - Trixter's Emblem Topper

With the trixter's emblem topper, Magi are granted the power to summon [Neland Quivermore](docs\Home.mdx), a well known member of the trickster clan. Effects all around the realm will begin to laugh with joy. Neland will also appear on status station screens, singing and dancing. Recharging this power will cost Magi a hefty 10,000 gold.

#### Power of Music - Pegasus and Unicorn Horn Toppers

The most helpful of all chaos powers, the power of music will grant all Magi with an active wand 1,000 gold. To go along with this, effects will begin to neigh like a unicorn. Glittertail will also appear on status stations, announcing the newly gained wealth of all Magi. The power can be recharged simply by collecting the [Heal](docs\Home.mdx), [Enchant Creature](docs\Home.mdx), and [Dazzle](docs\Home.mdx) runes.
