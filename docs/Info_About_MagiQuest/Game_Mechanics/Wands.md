**Wands** are the main tool a Magi will use on their adventure, and are required to play MagiQuest. Your wand is your primary method of interacting with the game. With it, you'll be able open treasure chests, enchant magical object, cast spells, and more. Your wand is able to track and update your progress with it's own unique wand ID, which is connected to your MagiQuest account. Upon purchase, all wands come equipped with a basic ball or gem topper. You can unscrew the basic topper, and replace it with a [topper](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Toppers.md) of your choice to customize your wand, and give it new powers.

### Types of Wands

#### Classic Wands

Classic wands are the original wand type and are colored brown. There are multiple versions of the classic wand, as over the years it's had many different iterations.

#### Dragon Wands

  > *"These sleek Wands have been created from a special combination of spells and other magical elements that grant their owners additional powers and abilities. You won't earn Dragon Wand powers on any Quests, they are exclusive to these mysterious marvels. Use them wisely!"*
  
  -- MagiQuest Online Shop

Dragon wands are distinguished from other wands because of their unique shape and exclusive in-game abilities. They are able to give you double experience points, double gold, extra protection during the [Dragon Adventure](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Dragon_Adventure.md), and the ability to use the Rune of Dragons twice in duels. The red and blue dragon wands have newer versions with less paint applied. The originals are pictured below.

#### Premium Wands

Premium wands were sold for a very short amount of time, exclusively at the [Myrtle Beach, SC](docs\Missing_Page.md) location. They were the precursor to dragon wands, and not much is known about them.

### Magic Wand Tree

Over the years, the origins of wands within the world of MagiQuest has changed somewhat. Originally, all wands were grown from the Magic Wand Tree. This could be seen in the lobby area of the first location, [Myrtle Beach, SC](docs\Missing_Page.md). Wands would be placed in the baskets around it, and staff members confirm that was the original intention. Later, when the MagiQuest Online Store opened, all wands were given unique flavor text. It's unknown if these would be considered canon.

The story of the Magic Wand Tree is further elaborated on in the third/fourth track of The Music of MagiQuest: Magic Wand Tree. Princess Candice refers to the Magic Wand Tree with she/her pronouns, and implies that she was not always a tree. However, the tree seems to be happy with her status, happy to see Magi using their wands to create magic.[^2]
