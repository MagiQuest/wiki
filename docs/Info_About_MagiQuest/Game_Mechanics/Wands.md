**Wands** are the main tool a Magi will use on their adventure, and are required to play MagiQuest. Your wand is your primary method of interacting with the game. With it, you'll be able open treasure chests, enchant magical object, cast spells, and more. Your wand is able to track and update your progress with it's own unique wand ID, which is connected to your MagiQuest account. Upon purchase, all wands come equipped with a basic ball or gem topper. You can unscrew the basic topper, and replace it with a [topper](docs\Home.mdx) of your choice to customize your wand, and give it new powers.
