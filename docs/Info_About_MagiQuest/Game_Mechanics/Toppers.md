Toppers are special accessories that replace the orb or gem on top of [wands](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Wands.md). They unlock specific powerful abilities depending on which ones you own. Many of them will allow you to instantly defeat powerful foes, or quickly help residents of the kingdom without trouble. Others can provide hints, or even cause a [chaos effect](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Chaos_Powers.md). However, since these abilities are so powerful, they need to be recharged once used. Most toppers also have lights in them, and will flash when casting.

While these special abilities are exclusive to toppers, they are not required to enjoy or complete the game. Topper powers currently work at all live legacy locations except for Pigeon Forge TN.

### Topper Powers

#### Red Dragon and Global Dragon: Fireburst

<img src="\img\Fireburst_Bros.webp" alt="Fireburst Bros" width="150" hight="113" title="Fireburst Bros"></img>

Red Dragon toppers grant the ability Fireburst. With it, you can instantly defeat [Winterra](docs\Home.mdx) the Ice Dragon, the [Goblin King](docs\Home.mdx), the [Silver Dragon](docs\Home.mdx), and the Dark One in the Crypt. To recharge Fireburst, you must defeat [Charlock](docs\Home.mdx) the Red Dragon. 

#### Ice Dragon and Winterra: Iceburst

<img src="\img\Iceburst_Sistas.webp" alt="Iceburst Sistas" width="150" hight="113" title="Iceburst Sistas"></img>

Ice Dragon Toppers grant you the power of Iceburst. The ability lets you instantly defeat [Charlock](docs\Home.mdx) the Red Dragon, the [Goblin King](docs\Home.mdx), and the Dark One in the Crypt. To recharge Iceburst, you'll need to defeat Winterra in battle. At Great Wolf Lodge locations, this topper is registered as Fireburst, due to Winterra not being present

#### Skull and Dark Gem: Laughing Skull

<img src="\img\LaughingLOL.webp" alt="Laughing LOL" width="150" hight="113" title="Laughing LOL"></img>

With the power of the laughing skull, you can instantly defeat [Charlock](docs\Home.mdx) the Red Dragon, [Winterra](docs\Home.mdx) the Ice Dragon, and the Dark One in the Crypt. To recharge these toppers, you must complete the Goblin and Princess Adventure. At Great Wolf Lodge locations without the Goblin King, the Dark Skull and Dark Gem is registered as the Blue Claw Topper. 

#### Pegasus and Unicorn Horn: Power of Music

<img src="\img\Unicornhorns.webp" alt="Unicorn Horns" width="150" hight="113" title="Unicorn Horns"></img>

The Pegasus and Unicorn Horn grant the power of music, but the effect of the topper is different depending on the location.

At Great Wolf Lodge locations, the power of music acts as a [chaos effect](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Chaos_Powers.md). Everyone with an active wand will be given 1000 gold, and a video of the Unicorn announcing the event will play on status stations . It must be recharged by collecting the [Dazzle](docs\Home.mdx), [Heal](docs\Home.mdx), and [Enchant Creature](docs\Home.mdx) Runes.

At locations with the Unicorn and Duel Master Adventures, these two toppers would instantly charm the Unicorn, Esmeralda, and the Old Man in the Stone. This would allow you to skip two long steps on the adventures, and cut down time spent on the [Music Rune](docs\Home.mdx). The topper power would need to be recharged by returning Glittertail's star to her. 

#### Ice Crystal and Pixie: Nature's Favor

<img src="\img\NaturesFavor.webp" alt="Nature's Favor" width="150" hight="113" title="Nature's Favor"></img>

With Nature's Favor, you can instantly dazzle the Pixie's crystal, the [Unicorn's](docs\Home.mdx) star and summon the [Princess](docs\Home.mdx)' jewels then return them directly to her for your reward. To recharge the ability, you normally have to collect the [Music Rune](docs\Home.mdx).

Since the Music Rune is no longer obtainable at any live location, any locations where this power is still present require instead that you collect the [Master Magi Rune](docs\Home.mdx) to recharge the ability.

In [ShadowQuest](docs\Home.mdx) at Great Wolf Lodge, Nature's Favor can be used to manipulate time to your benefit at any of the virtual location screens. This time warp function does not need to be recharged, and can always be used. 

#### Pink Gem and Majestic Crown: Master Healing

<img src="\img\MasterHealing.webp" alt="Master Healing" width="150" hight="113" title="Master Healing"></img>

With the power of healing you can instantly repair the artifacts of the [Pixies](docs\Home.mdx) and Glittertail the Unicorn. It will also save you once in a duel against [Charlock](docs\Home.mdx), [Winterra](docs\Home.mdx), [The Silver Dragon](docs\Home.mdx), and the [Goblin King](docs\Home.mdx). The saving effect will occur if you loose all of your mana, and it will restore you to full health. You can recharge these toppers by collecting the [Healing Rune](docs\Home.mdx) once again. 

#### Armillary: Learned Owl

<img src="\img\OwlTopper.webp" alt="Owl Topper" width="150" hight="113" title="Owl Topper"></img>

With the power of the Armillary, you can summon the keeper of secrets in the kingdom, the Learned Owl. You can access his hints at any status station. Some of the hints will be generic trivia, and some will be specific to the quest or adventure you're currently on. You can get a new hint by tapping the button again.

Recharging the power to summon the Owl works differently depending on location. At non-lodge locations, you have to regain the [Master Magi Rune](docs\Home.mdx). At Great Wolf Lodges, the Learned Owl never needs charging. He is always available to help with the "?" icon at any status screen. 

#### Trixter's Emblem: Power of Laughter

<img src="\img\Chaostrick.webp" alt="Chaos Trick" width="150" hight="113" title="Chaos Trick"></img>

The power of laughter is a [chaos effect](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Chaos_Powers.md), granted only by the Trixter's Emblem. Casting your wand at the chaos effect object will cause status stations to play a video of [Neland Quivermore](docs\Home.mdx) laughing and dancing. It will also cause most objects like stars and treasure chests to activate and begin to laugh. Recharging the power costs 10,000 gold. 

#### Blue Claw / Gauntlet: Summon Xaiver

<img src="\img\Chaosxaiver.webp" alt="Chaos Xavier" width="150" hight="113" title="Chaos Xavier"></img>

With the power of the Blue Claw, you'll be able to summon [Xavier](docs\Home.mdx) to the realm with a [chaos effect](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Chaos_Powers.md). Xavier will make his presence known by his laughter echoing throughout the building. A video will play on any status station screen, and other objects will broadcast his voice as well. To recharge the blue claw's power, you'll need to collect the entire set of core runes. 

#### Rune Collector Topper

<img src="\img\Runecollector.webp" alt="Rune Collector" width="150" hight="113" title="Rune Collector"></img>

The Rune Collector Topper does not have a unique gameplay ability. Instead, it acts as a way to hang various runes from your wand. Since it does not light up, it's also able to have another topper attachment point on top of it, allowing you to stack a topper with a gameplay ability on top. Or, if you'd like to have an extra unwieldy wand, more Rune Collectors. Some locations (such as [Myrtle Beach, SC](docs\Home.mdx)) will register this topper as an Armillary on your account, giving you it's topper power. 

#### Great Wolf Topper

The Great Wolf Topper has no ability of its own. Rather, its intended purpose is allowing you to pick any one topper power for it to mimic.
