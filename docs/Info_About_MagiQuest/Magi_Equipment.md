### [Wands](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Wands.md)

It all begins with a [wand](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Wands.md)! The secrets of MagiQuest are unlocked through the use of your very own, personalized Magic Wand. Each wand remembers you by name, and knows what Quests and Adventures youâ€™ve completed, tracks your Gold and other points starting from the very first day you enter the kingdom! Your wand will work and remember you at every MagiQuest location. Once you know how to wield a wand, the world of MagiQuest can be yours!

### [Toppers](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Toppers.md)

A Magic Wand is a very personal thing, and there are dozens of ways to adorn your wand using fantastical and beautifully sculpted [Toppers](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Toppers.md) to help your wand say something special about you! Many of the MagiQuest Wand Toppers have thrilling features like lights and motion, making it particularly helpful to be seen in dungeons and crypts.

### [Golden Key](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Golden_Key.md)

A [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md) possessing the Golden Key will be able to unlock the most hidden secrets that exist within the kingdom. It is not linked to a Magi or their [wand](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Wands.md), so anyone possessing a key can use it.

### [Compass](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Kingdom_Compass.md)

Possession of the compass grants a [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md) the ability to use the Map of Knowledge which reveals the location of the enchanted items, areas and creatures that reside within the kingdom. It unlocks 9 additional quests which you can play through in a game similar to MagiQuest called [Compass Quest](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Content_Sets\CompassQuest.md).

### [MagiQuest Costumes](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Costumes.md)

Whether cloaked in secrecy, or boldly displaying your Castle's colors, these magical garments will clothe you for any Quest and distract your opponent in any Duel with magical style! Costumes include Capes, Tunics, and Belts.
