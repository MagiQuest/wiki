Each [MagiQuest](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\index.mdx) **rune** symbolizes a [Quest](docs\Quests\index.mdx) or [Adventure](docs\Adventures\index.mdx) in the game. Runes give your [wand](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Wands.md) new powers, depending on the type of rune. For more detailed information on each rune, visit their respective pages below.

*Below is a list of every rune featured in MagiQuest Legacy. For information on the runes featured in ShadowQuest, please see the [ShadowQuest page](docs\Home.mdx).*

### [Clan](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Clans\index.mdx) Runes

Clan Runes are earned by completing quests. Each one represents the unique abilities of each of [clan](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Clans\index.mdx), and are given by their representatives. A Magi's clan does not affect their ability to earn any particular Clan Rune. Clan runes may be part of the requirements to obtain certain adventure runes.
