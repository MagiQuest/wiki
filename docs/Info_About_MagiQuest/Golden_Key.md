The **Golden Key** is a special item that can be used to unlock secret areas of the kingdom. This item can only be used at the [Pigeon Forge, TN](docs\Realm_Locations\Pigeon_Forge_TN.md) location but was at one point an item that could be used at the Myrtle Beach, SC location as well.

### Realms that use the key

#### Pigeon Forge, TN

You can acquire the power of the key temporarily by casting your wand at the key stored in the village warehouse. This will grant you the ability to unlock the secret door into the [goblin's](docs\Missing_Page.md) lair (located in the forest) You can also use the key to open a secret door in the village that takes you to the lair of [Charlock the Red Dragon](docs\Missing_Page.md).

#### Myrtle Beach, SC

The key could be rubbed on the side of a chest, there was a key sticker on the spot but these often rubbed off over time, this would open the chest and allow you to get gold from it two more times. As of 2015, this location has closed.
