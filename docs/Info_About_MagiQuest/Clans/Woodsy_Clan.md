The 'Woodsy Clan are tree-dwelling, enchanted, mystical [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md) and creatures who can sometimes be a little mischievous. Their rune automatically empowers you with the ability to communicate with creatures and enchant them to speak to you with the [Enchant Creatures Rune](docs\Quests\Enchant_Creature_Rune.md). Only the Pixie [Serena](docs\Home.mdx) can grant this rune to a Magi.
