Majestics are regal, enlightened [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md) whose nobility precedes them. They possess the power to heal creatures and mend magical objects with the [Healing Rune](docs\Missing_Page.md). The powers of this rune can only be granted to Magi after an encounter with the Princess Candice.
