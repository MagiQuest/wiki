**The Ancient Book of Wisdom** is a book of clues to objectives in a quest written in verses intended to aid the player when playing [MagiQuest](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\index.mdx). All books are different depending on location and some have quests exclusive to that place.The book is usually given to players after purchasing the game and wand.

All that a Magi needs to know is contained in The Ancient Book of Wisdom. There are countless volumes of this guide to Quests and [Adventures](docs\Adventures\index.mdx). Young [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md) start with the first volume. In certain locations, once you have reached the Master Magi level, the Master Book will be revealed to you. This book is vital in understanding the game and how to play it correctly.
