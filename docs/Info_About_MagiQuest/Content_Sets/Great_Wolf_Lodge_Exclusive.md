In 2006, Creative Kingdoms partnered with Great Wolf Resorts to bring [MagiQuest](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\index.mdx) to the [Pocono Mountains, PA](docs\Home.mdx) [Great Wolf Lodge](docs\Home.mdx). As the partnership continued and MagiQuest was brought to every lodge, exclusive game content was made for the locations. Existing quests were also changed to remove steps deemed unnecessary.

### Exclusive Quests and Adventures

#### Ursa Major Content

In 2008, the [Pocono Mountains, PA](docs\Home.mdx) and [Grapevine, TX](docs\Home.mdx) locations were the first to receive a new set of quests and adventures. They introduce new gameplay mechanics to lodge locations, as well as new characters Princess Amora and Ursa Major. The quests were designed with a forest aesthetic in mind to compliment Great Wolf Lodge's brand. Magi are able to harness the power of the stars and help a living constellation. These quests and adventure take the place of the [Lightning Rune](docs\Quests\Lightning_Rune.md) and [Princess & Goblin King Adventure](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Princess_&_Goblin_King_Adventure.md).

  - [Celestial Rune](docs\Home.mdx)
  - [Great Wolf Rune](docs\Home.mdx)
  - [Ursa Major Adventure](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Ursa_Major_Adventure.md)

#### CompassQuest Additions

*Main Article: [CompassQuest](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Content_Sets\CompassQuest.md)*

When CompassQuest was brought over from Myrtle Beach, SC to Great Wolf Lodge, it received seven additional quests. In them, Magi become experts on specific locations in the kingdom, and eventually can become a Master Cartographer. The two original quests from Myrtle Beach were also carried over, but it's magical map functionality was not.

  - Piney Path Rune
  - Whispery Woods Rune
  - Dragon's Den Rune
  - Enchanted Woods Rune
  - Forgotten Hall Rune
  - Tangled Woods Rune
  - [Master Cartographer Rune](docs\Home.mdx)

#### Quest Master's Suite

*Main article: Quest Master's Suite*

At a small number of lodges for a short period of time, a MagiQuest themed room was introduced known as the Quest Master's Suite. In the room, Magi could select to go on one of two exclusive quests and an adventure.

  - Artistry Rune
  - Summon Creatures Rune
  - Portal Unicorn Adventure

### Other Elements Developed for Great Wolf Lodge

  - For MagiQuest installations before 2008 (besides Myrtle Beach), the Gargoyle gives out the [Lightning Rune](docs\Quests\Lightning_Rune.md) instead of the Man in the Mist or the [Duel Master](docs\Home.mdx). The first location that received this change was Pocono Mountains, PA.
  - Smudgy, the creature in the cage from the Pixie Adventure, was changed from a strange creature to an otter.
  - The [Reveal Rune](docs\Home.mdx) was removed as a requirement for the Pixie Adventure and [Dragon Adventure](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Dragon_Adventure.md) for lodges, as well as the Distraction Rune from the Princess & Goblin King Adventure. These runes are not present at any lodges with [one exception](docs\Home.mdx).
  - The Dragon Painting used in the Dragon Adventure was originally developed for Poconos.
  - The cauldron step was removed from the Ice Arrow Rune quest, with videos adjusted accordingly.
  - The three adventures that were chosen to be featured at lodges all received new edits of their intro videos.
  - New animal effects were created to decorate [forest realms](docs\Realm_Locations\index.mdx). They are not part of any quest except rarely the Summon Creatures Rune. They include a hanging bear rug, bear carving, raccoons on a roof, chipmunks on a swing, raccoon on a swing, and more. These animals debuted in 2006 at Poconos and made their way to nearly every lodge.
  - An exclusive [topper](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Toppers.md) was made to be sold only at Great Wolf Lodge. It features a wolf head on a wooden base.
