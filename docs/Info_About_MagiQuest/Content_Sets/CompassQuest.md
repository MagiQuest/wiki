**CompassQuest** is an expansion to [MagiQuest](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\index.mdx) which was launched at the Myrtle Beach, SC location in 2008. It later expanded to a large portion of [Great Wolf Lodge](docs\Home.mdx) locations shortly after. At lodges, CompassQuest is a separate purchase from MagiQuest, and can be played for the duration of your stay for $14.99. This expansion makes extensive use of the [kingdom compass](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Kingdom_Compass.md) for most of it's nine quests.

### Gameplay

CompassQuest's gameplay is similar to MagiQuest's quests in that the goal is to find certain sets of objects in the building. However, along with casting your wand, you'll also need to place your compass into specially made wayfinder podiums. There are no adventures, but the quests themselves are generally more involved than MagiQuest's. They are typically timed and must be completed within nine minutes, with a few exceptions.

The story follows [Bartholomew](docs\Home.mdx), and his mission to create a map of the kingdom. He trains Magi to become cartographers, mapping out and finding points of interest in various areas of the land.

### Trivia

  - Bartholomew only appears in video form in the first two quests, Wayfinder and Treasure. This is because his actor was not brought in to film new footage for the Great Wolf Lodge exclusive quests. Instead, text explaining the quest is displayed on the status stations.
  - At Myrtle Beach, SC, completing CompassQuest would unlock an interactive map that would show you the location of every item for every quest and adventure in the building. A recreation of this functionality can be seen [here](https://sinkillerj.github.io/MQMyrtMapViewer/mapview.html).
