The Ice Dragon Saga was an expansion of the game that never made it into any [Forest Realms](https://magiquest.wiki/tags/forest-realm) and was only at [Kingdom Realms](https://magiquest.wiki/tags/kingdom-realm). It starts when you become a [Master Magi](docs\Missing_Page.md) and get the Master Magi's Book of Wisdom. Once you get the Master Magi's Book of Wisdom, You must collect 3 runes. The [Fire Rune](docs\Missing_Page.md), The [Shield Rune](docs\Missing_Page.md), And the [Potion Rune](docs\Missing_Page.md). Once you get all three, You unlock the [Ice Dragon Adventure](docs\Missing_Page.md).
