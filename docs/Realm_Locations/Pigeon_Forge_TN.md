The **Pigeon Forge, Tennessee** location is a Kingdom Realm with 14 quests and 4 [adventures](docs\Adventures\index.mdx). It is the only currently operational Kingdom Realm, as well the last MagiQuest Legacy location not within a [Great Wolf Lodge](docs\Home.mdx). Due to the closures of other Kingdom Realms, the [Ice Dragon Saga](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Content_Sets\Ice_Dragon_Saga.md) and [Distract Rune](docs\Home.mdx) are exclusive to this location. Pigeon Forge also previously featured dueling podiums; however, they have been down since 2020. Although the building itself is labeled as MagiQuest, the MagiQuest game only takes up the second floor. The first floor features pirate themed mini golf, a mirror maze, and an arcade.

### Game Areas

The game areas at Pigeon Forge are themed as different areas of a magical kingdom. Each of them are large rooms, with their entryways themed as large portals. The main game areas- the Forest Realm, Village Realm, and Dragon Realm- contain a variety of effects, status stations, and encounter stations. One other unifying trait they share is the presence of small dividing walls that contain quest items and prevent Magi from taking a straight path through the realm.

#### Forest Realm

The Forest Realm is the largest of the three main areas. It is further split into a few different sections: the Enchanted Forest, Dark Forest, and the Goblin King's Chambers.

##### Enchanted Forest

<img src="\img\Pigeon_Enchanted_Forest.webp" alt="The center of the Enchanted Forest" width="180" hight="135" title="The center of the Enchanted Forest"></img>

The bright and mystical Enchanted Forest is the first area a Magi will visit upon entering the Forest Realm. The walls feature tall, somewhat bent trees, some with holes and a small pair of peering eyes. Large trees can also be seen dotting the path, which is outlined by rock walls with small bushes, and the occasional wooden archway. Magi will find the Pixie's Perch here, home to [Serena](docs\Home.mdx). The Lady in the Leaves, Old Man in the Stump, and Smudgy also reside here. Magi who finish a lesson in the Training Room exit into the Enchanted Forest; in fact, the exterior of the room is visible from the forest. In recent years two extra quest stones have been added to the area.

This area shares similarities with the Enchanted Woods, an area found in many Forest Realms.

##### Dark Forest

Deeper within the Forest Realm lies the Dark Forest. On the walls are thin trees even more twisted than those in the Enchanted Forest. Rock walls divide the path, and a large, leafless, talking tree stands over the area. The Lady in the Wall and Trixie the pixie call the area home. At the edge of the forest is a large stone wall with a secret door to the Goblin King's Chambers.

This area shares similarities with the Twisted Woods, an area found in many Forest Realms.

##### Goblin King's Chambers

The Goblin King's Chambers are locked behind a large stone door, only opened through a magical key found elsewhere. Within is the throne room of the [Goblin King](docs\Home.mdx), protected by the Goblin Guard. The chambers also contain an infinite hallway, an effect achieved with two large mirrors facing each other.

#### Village Realm

<img src="\img\Pigeon_Village_Realm_1.webp" alt="The village realm" width="180" hight="135" title="The village realm"></img>

The Village Realm is the most unique of any at Pigeon Forge, being unlike any other themed area at a location. It features multiple small buildings that guests can enter and explore, including a book shop, armory, a warehouse, and the Majestic Inn. Each of these buildings contain magical objects used as part of quests and adventures: Princess Candice can be found within the Majestic Inn, while [The Owl](docs\Home.mdx) and the Wizard Book reside outside. The dueling podiums are in the warehouse in the back of the village. Across the path from the buildings players can explore is a set of building facades, including a robe shop and the Heroes Podium. The main path is divided by small smooth stone walls with the occasional archway. Birds can be heard chirping in the area, and are seen perching around the village. Trees similar to those in the Enchanted Forest can be seen around the edges of town. Finally, a secret stone door to the Dragon's Realm lies near the warehouse.

#### Dragon Realm

<img src="\img\Pigeon_Dragon_Realm.webp" alt="Entering the back of the Dragon Realm" width="180" hight="135" title="Entering the back of the Dragon Realm"></img>

The Dragon Realm is a dark and imposing area, with tall stone brick walls decorated with dragon head designs and strange crystal orbs. The tight corridors of the dungeon ensure no outside light comes in. The realm is home to all three dragons in the kingdom: [Charlock](docs\Home.mdx), [Winterra](docs\Home.mdx), and [The Silver Dragon](docs\Home.mdx). Charlock and Winterra share a lair, while Silver can be encountered at the Web Portal. The Gargoyle and the Dungeon Eyes also reside within these dank halls. There is also a secret door to the Village Realm near the portal to the Dragon's Lair.

#### Other Areas

##### Stone Circle

<img src="\img\Pigeon_Stone_Circle.webp" alt="The Stone Circle and Forest Realm portal" width="180" hight="135" title="The Stone Circle and Forest Realm portal"></img>

The Stone Circle is the central hub of the realm of Pigeon Forge. All three of the major realms connect to it. The titular stone circle is comprised of Quest Stones, where every Magi begins a new quest or adventure. The area is on a balcony, overlooking the downstairs entrance, which the portal star hangs above. The area has a small handful of other magical items, including the key to gain access to the Goblin King's Chambers. The one character who calls the area home is the Man in the Mist, who can be found outside the entrance to the Dragon Realm. Finally, by the stairs is the wand registration desk and entrance to the Training Room.

##### Training Room

The Training Room is located in a small hut near the Stone Circle by the stairs and wand registration desk. Before new players begin their journey proper, a Magi Guide (staff member) will bring them to the Training Room and do a short presentation on the basics of MagiQuest. This presentation used to include a video hosted by the [Questmaster](docs\Home.mdx). The room contains a few unique objects, and then exits into the Enchanted Forest by the crystal cluster.

##### Market Place

The Market Place is the only area of the MagiQuest game located on the first floor. Although the present market place only consists of a few wand and topper displays, there were previously more elaborate display stands themed to the clans, with tunics, runes, keys, and other [accessories](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi_Equipment.md). There was also a video display and a large MagiQuest sign with a wand-activated crystal ball.

### Notable Features

#### Exclusive Content

As the final Kingdom Realm, Pigeon Forge has a number of exclusive challenges for the Magi who wishes to experience everything MagiQuest has to offer. Upon becoming a Master Magi, players will receive a message from [Carren](docs\Home.mdx), unlocking the Ice Dragon Saga. The saga takes Magi on the quests to earn the Fire Rune, Shield Rune, and Potion Rune. After earning the required runes, Magi confront [Winterra](docs\Home.mdx) in the Ice Dragon Adventure.

As part of the original set of runes, the Shadow Clan's Distract Rune is exclusive to Pigeon Forge. Additionally, the [Portal Rune](docs\Home.mdx) quest uses it's extended version that was debuted at Kingdom Realms starting in 2008.

#### Secret Doors

Unique to Pigeon Forge is the mechanic of secret doors. These doors closed shut, and can normally only be opened through magical means. The first is the "Goblin Door" is found at the back of the Dark Forest, and is the only way into the Goblin King's Chambers. To open it, Magi must cast at a magical key in front of the Village Realm portal, then cast at the key symbol by the door. The second door is known as the "Dragon Door" and connects the back of the Village Realm to the back of the Dragon Realm. Opening this door requires Magi to obtain the [Rune of Dragons](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Dragon_Adventure.md#rune-of-dragons), and acts as a useful shortcut as reward for confronting Charlock. Alternatively, both of these doors can be opened by inserting a Key of Gold into a nearby keyhole.

#### Hidden Objects

Within the Goblin King's Chambers lies two mirrors facing one-another. Casting into the center of each of them reveals two hidden objects in the mirror, the Princess' tiara, and a crystal. This interesting effect was never used again at a MagiQuest location, and makes for a devious hiding spot for the tiara.

#### Lack of Topper Powers and Other Features

Pigeon Forge is the only location to not have any form of topper powers, making them purely cosmetic. The location also does not have the most current GameStation version, meaning data from other locations will not be able to be loaded.

### History

*This section is a work in progress. Some dates may be inaccurate.*

**2009** - The Pigeon Forge, TN location opens on May 19th, 2009 with 11 quests and 3 adventures.

**2010** - The Silver Dragon Portal Adventure is added, originally only playable by Magi who completed MagiQuest Online. The Silver Dragon could be dueled in the same encounter station as Charlock, with the Point-and-Cast podium being replaced with a TouchDuel podium. Dueling was also added during this time, originally located downstairs.

**2017** - Pigeon Forge receives a variety of new content and props due to the closure of the East Hanover, NJ location. The Ice Dragon Saga and it's associated quests and adventure are added. The Silver Dragon is moved to his current home in the Dragon Realm to make room for Winterra. Extra quest stones are added, and other decorative elements from East Hanover are put up.

**Events with Unknown Dates** - Pigeon Forge is disconnected from globals, no longer allowing account data to be sent to and from other locations. Communication with Great Wolf Lodge and Creative Kingdoms stops.

**2022 - 2023** - The staff at Pigeon Forge begin experimenting with gameplay changes. Objects such as the key, Magi Warrior's Code Book, Book of Freezing Spells, and treasure chests are shuffled around. The buttons on the Quest Stone menus receive an overhaul. Various sound effects are changed, and videos begin to be trimmed and edited.

### Ancient Book of Wisdom

See [Pigeon Forge, TN/ABOW](docs\Realm_Locations\Pigeon_Forge_TN_ABOW.md)

### Trivia

  - Pigeon Forge has two Man in the Mist status stations, technically having men in the mist.
  - A few objects that are not used on any quest are speculated to have been intended for future expansion. The gargoyle statue in the Goblin King's Chambers is believed to have been intended as the gargoyle you distract on the Unicorn Adventure. The unused Book of Treasures was commonly assigned as the item to activate [chaos topper powers](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Game_Mechanics\Chaos_Powers.md).
