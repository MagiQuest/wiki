# Realm Locations

Locations (also known as Realms) are the real-world places where [MagiQuest](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\index.mdx) can be played. They are most often found within the walls of [Great Wolf Lodges](docs\Missing_Page.md), but realms that are entirely dedicated to MagiQuest exist as well. MagiQuest locations can be found all across the United States of America as well as one location in Canada and two locations formerly in Japan. Since 2005, 30 different MagiQuest locations have existed.

## MagiQuest Legacy Locations

Locations in MagiQuest Legacy are assigned a realm type based on their size. Different quests and adventures are available to [Magi](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Magi.md) in each one, and there is variance even within the category.

- Forest Realms <img src="\img\docs\one-time\Realm_Locations\index\Forest_Icon.webp" alt="The legacy 'Forest Realms' icon" width="32" hight="16" title="The legacy 'Forest Realms' icon"></img> are the most common type of MagiQuest location. They are part of Great Wolf Lodges, and game elements are integrated throughout the resort. Forest realms all have three core adventures, always including the [Dragon Adventure](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Dragon_Adventure.md) and Pixie Adventure and their associated quests. They will also either have the [Princess & Goblin King Adventure](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Princess_&_Goblin_King_Adventure.md) or the [Ursa Major Adventure](docs\Adventures\Adventures_in_MagiQuest_Legacy\Ursa_Major_Adventure.md).
- Kingdom Realms <img src="\img\docs\one-time\Realm_Locations\index\Kingdom_Icon.webp" alt="The legacy 'Kingdom Realms' icon" width="32" hight="16" title="The legacy 'Kingdom Realms' icon"></img> are MagiQuest locations that are distinguished by being dedicated spaces to play in themed environments. They will always contain the Dragon, Pixie, and Goblin King adventures, and often others as well.
  - Lite locations <img src="\img\docs\one-time\Realm_Locations\index\Lite_Icon.webp" alt="The legacy 'Lite locations' icon" width="32" hight="16" title="The legacy 'Lite locations' icon"></img> are a specific type of Kingdom Realm utilising the MagiQuest Lite system; they use modular pieces to create the game environment instead of custom built decorations for the location.
- Mega Kingdom Realms <img src="\img\docs\one-time\Realm_Locations\index\MegaKingdom_Icon.webp" alt="The legacy 'Mega Kingdom Realms' icon" width="32" hight="16" title="The legacy 'Mega Kingdom Realms' icon"></img> are the largest MagiQuest locations, known for their elaborate theming and immersive environments. They also always have all of the quests and adventures in the [Legacy Base Content](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Content_Sets\Legacy_Base_Content.md) set, as well as the [Ice Dragon Saga](docs\Info_About_MagiQuest\Content_Sets\Ice_Dragon_Saga.md).

## MagiQuest Chronicles [2.0] Locations
