## Who are you & what do you do?

Hey there! I'm [dukedotdev](https://rec.net/user/dukedotdev), but most people call me Duke. I started RR back in 2020 and have played on-and-off for the last four years. I generally play in private instances and do circuits, but you may see me out and about in a public. I prefer screen mode but I like to hop on my modded Vive Cosmos Elite every now and then.

## Are you a RR dev?

I'm not! Just because I have "dev" in my name doesn't mean I work for Rec Room. The reason that's there is because I develop games and websites! If you want to confirm someone is a RR dev, check their cheer badge. If it's the Rec Room logo, that means they're legit!

## Why do you have so many subs?

Because people like what I do! None of them are botted and I never went around and begged for them, I just made what I wanted to and people who liked it followed. I think I get this question a lot because I don't own any popular rooms, and that's because I used to. To break down the sub count, around 700~ of my subs came from military maps I co-owned and circuiteered for [^Viper_MilitaryRR & ^Desert_Force_Military]. Around 200~ came from me moderating a popular room [^Survive0FZombies]. The rest just came from my inventions and people meeting me in rooms and thinking I'm cool.

## Someone claiming to be you on an alt wants co in my map! How do I know it's you?

As a general rule of thumb, I don't tend to reach out to do Cv2 for people. You can tell if it's me though by checking the account name [the name following the @ symbol]! I only own four accounts and operate three. The three I actually use are [@dukedotdev](https://rec.net/user/dukedotdev), [@Bugcrowd_dukedotdev](https://rec.net/user/Bugcrowd_dukedotdev), and [@Bugcrowd_dukedotdev2](https://rec.net/user/Bugcrowd_dukedotdev2). I also own [@.Duke](https://rec.net/user/.Duke), but I don't play on it. I had many other alt accounts but I've unlinked them as I don't use them anymore. If someone claiming to be me doesn't have one of those account names, they're lying!

## What do you mean you do "exploit tests", are you a hacker? {#rr-bugcrowd}

Exploit Tests mean finding vulnerabilities that can be used by bad actors and reporting them to Rec Room! This does mean I have to hack and do things regular players aren't allowed to, but only under certain conditions and with heavy restrictions. For more info on this, see the [Rec Room Bugcrowd Program](https://bugcrowd.com/recroom-og).

## Why won't you accept my friend request?

I typically don't add people as I like to keep my friends list short on RR. This isn't because you've done anything wrong or that I don't like you, I just tend to keep it to my close friends. Keep sending those requests though! I go through my requests monthly and I add those who look interesting. If your pfp or name is eye-catching and you have a decent portfolio, I might add you!

## How do I contact you?

If you want to contact me for something Rec Room related, please email [rrcontact@dukedot.dev](mailto:rrcontact@dukedot.dev) with your RR account name and what you needed me for.

### I want to work on a map with you!

Depends on what that map is.

#### I have a military map, can you-

No, I don't want to be associated with the clan side of RR anymore. No, your sub count / token count / seller swag / whatever else you have to offer me won't change that. Please leave me alone or you will be blocked.

#### I have a cashgrab, want co?

No, I'd rather not have my portfolio tarnished with whatever costume map you've thrown together. No, your sub count / token count / seller swag / whatever else you have to offer me won't change that. Please leave me alone or you will be blocked.

#### I have a [literally anything else]!

Maybe! Send in an email to [rrcolab@dukedot.dev](mailto:rrcolab@dukedot.dev) with your RR account name, idea / map, and I'll take a look at your portfolio to see if I want to work with you.
